**Towards Robust Breast Segmentation: Leveraging Depth Awareness and Convexity Optimization For Tackling Data Scarcity**

## üìÑ Abstract
> Breast segmentation plays a critical role for objective pre‚Äë and post‚Äëoperative aesthetic evaluation but is challenged by limited data, class imbalance, and anatomical variability. We introduce an encoder‚Äìdecoder framework with a Segment Anything Model (SAM) backbone, enhanced with synthetic depth maps and a multi‚Äëterm loss combining weighted cross‚Äëentropy, convexity, and depth alignment constraints. Evaluated on a 120-patient dataset, our approach achieves a balanced test dice score of 98.75%‚Äîa 4.5% improvement over prior methods‚Äîwith dice of 95.5% (breast) and 89.2% (nipple). Depth injection reduces noise and focuses on anatomical regions (+0.47% body, +1.04% breast dice), while convexity optimization improves nipple mask plausibility to 99.86%.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **SAM-Driven Encoding**: Leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) backbone for robust feature extraction
- **Depth-Aware Segmentation**: Integrates synthetic depth maps from [Depth-Anything-v2](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything) to enhance geometric understanding
- **Convexity Optimization**: Novel loss formulation enforcing anatomical plausibility for nipple regions
- **Multi-Term Loss**: Combines weighted cross-entropy, depth alignment, and convexity constraints
- **Cross-Dataset Robustness**: Validated on CINDERELLA dataset with strong generalization

## üìä Results
| Region  | DSC Score (%) | Improvement |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Body**    | 98.7          | +0.47%      |
| **Breast**  | 95.5          | +1.04%      |
| **Nipple**  | 89.2          | +3% Conv    |
| **Mean**    | 98.75         | +4.5%       |

*Comparison with SoTA models:*
| Model       | Breast DSC | Nipple DSC |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| MobileNet   | 89.8%      | 78.1%      |
| Segformer   | 94.3%      | 88.8%      |
| **Ours**    | **95.5%**  | **89.2%**  |
